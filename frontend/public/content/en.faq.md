### FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly do you need from me?

We are interested in your SCHUFA data, which you received in letter form according to the Federal Data Protection Act ยง34 and which consists of at least four pages. We DO NOT want the first page of this letter (with your name and address) or the last page. We need the pages with the tables and the penultimate page, which could contain some information about requests from banks, credit approvals, etc. in a continuous text. We do not need the last page. If you do not want to transmit data to us, leave it out or redact it - you can do the redactions directly here in the application.

### What do I do when facing problems?

Please send an e-mail to <mailto:support@openschufa.de>.

### What is the purpose of the questionnaire?

The questionnaire should provide important information for the analysis of the scoring and its effects. Therefore we ask you to answer as many questions as possible about your personal situation. For example, we ask for so-called negative characteristics that can lead to someone no longer getting credit. Here the questionnaire can provide important information for comparing the data with the information.

### Can I send you my information by mail?

No. The data can only be transferred using the web app at www.openschufa.de. A transmission by e-mail or by post is NOT possible.

### I have access to the SCHUFA-Online account, can I send you the data from there?

No. We need the format of the self-disclosure according to the Federal Data Protection Act ยง34, which SCHUFA issues to you once a year free of charge. If you have not yet applied for a free self-disclosure, you can do so now at www.selbstauskunft.net/schufa. The data donation runs until September.

### How is the data stored?

The data of the photos or scans as well as your answers from the questionnaire will be uploaded to a server via an encrypted connection (https) after you have sent and agreed to the data protection declaration. The servers are located in Frankfurt and run on the account of AlgorithmWatch gGmbH. The data is regularly downloaded from our server (secure connection), then the images are made machine-readable on local computers (offline) using character recognition (OCR).

### Who has access to the data?

The machine-readable data is stored locally and encrypted using PGP. These encrypted archives will be forwarded to the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) and the editorial offices (SPIEGEL ONLINE, Bayerischer Rundfunk) via USB stick. If there is no objection from a data protection law point of view, the machine-readable data will be made publicly available.

### Why do I get an ID?

The machine-readable data remains stored indefinitely for research purposes and for journalistic evaluation by AlgorithmWatch, OKF and the editorial offices. If you donate your data, you will receive an ID (randomly generated) after the upload, which you can save or have sent to you by e-mail (we do not save the e-mail address!). The ID is linked to the data - but not to your name. With this ID you can contact support@openschufa.de if you wish to have your data deleted at a later date. We store when the data was transferred as the only meta-date. IP addresses are not stored.

### Is the software from OpenSCHUFA Open Source?

Yes. The code can be found [on Github](https://github.com/algorithmwatch/openschufa).
