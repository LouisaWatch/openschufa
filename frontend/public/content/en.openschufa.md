### Information

You don't get any credit, no mobile phone contract, and you always lose out when applying for the beautiful apartment. Why? Because of the SCHUFA! Really? Does the SCHUFA disadvantage one group of people compared to another? Does it increase injustice?

OpenSCHUFA is a joint project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany (OKF) and AlgorithmWatch (AW). After a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.startnext.com/openschufa) in February/March 2018, about 1200 supporters raised almost 44,000 euros, dedicated for the development of the open source software on the site and the implementation of the project. The project is supported by our media partner Spiegel Online.
