### Declaration of consent

I agree that AlgorithmWatch gGmbH may collect my personal data from the SCHUFA data I voluntarily provided and the questionnaire I voluntarily completed with socio-demographic information:

* collects, processes and uses data for its own purposes, namely the creation of a broad and real database and its evaluation for the purpose of scientific journalistic analysis, documentation and reporting with regard to the scoring procedures practiced by SCHUFA and stores them for an indefinite period;

* to the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) and to the editorial offices of Spiegel-Online and Bayerischer Rundfunk Data for their scientific journalistic analysis, documentation and reporting on the scoring procedures practiced by SCHUFA.

I am aware that I can revoke these consents at any time without giving reasons to AlgorithmWatch gGmbH, Bergstr. 22, 10115 Berlin, or by e-mail at <mailto:info@algorithmwatch.org> with effect for the future. As a result, my data will be deleted and no longer used by AlgorithmWatch gGmbH.
