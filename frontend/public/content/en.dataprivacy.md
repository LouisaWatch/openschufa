### 2. Collection and storage of personal data and nature and purpose of their use

#### a.) When visiting the website
When you access our website www.openschufa.de, information is automatically sent to our website server by the web browser used on your end device. This information is temporarily stored in what is referred to as a log file. The following information is recorded without any interaction on your part and stored until automatic erasure:
date and time of your access.

These data are then processed by us for the following purposes:

* ensuring a smooth connection to the website,
* ensuring an enjoyable website user experience,
* for other administrative purposes.

The legal basis of data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the purposes for data collection stated above. Under no circumstances will we use the collected data for the purpose of making inferences therefrom regarding your person. All stored data will be erased no later than 7 days after their collection.

#### b) When using our website

AlgorithmWatch gGmbH receives photographs and/or scans of users' SCHUFA [German General Credit Protection Association] self-reports voluntarily uploaded by users via mobile phone or personal computer through the website www.openschufa.de. The user is asked to upload a photograph or scan of his or her SCHUFA self-report, except the first and last page, via the upload function. The following data are recorded and stored:

All data which can be derived from the SCHUFA self-report such as:
* information on the amount of a credit facility
* scoring values regarding the credit rating of a user
* bad SCHUFA credit entries

After successful upload, the user will receive a randomly generated 16 or 32-digit ID which he or she should keep carefully for later reference. The user needs this ID code to contact AlgorithmWatch gGmbH and obtain access to his or her stored data or have them erased.
Data processing is performed with the journalistic and scientific objective of analysing how SCHUFA functions on the basis of a pool of wide-ranging real data and to critically examine the scoring method under the aspects of transparency and fairness.
Data processing is performed in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of voluntarily given consent.
After consent has been given, data originating from the SCHUFA self-reports and the replies to questionnaires will be uploaded through an encrypted connection to the [Digital Ocean](https://www-digitalocean.com/) server.

The recorded data will also be encrypted using PGP and locally stored. The files stored at Digital Ocean will be erased in October 2018. The photographs/scans with the SCHUFA self-reports will be completely erased from the offline servers in December 2018. We will not store any SCHUFA self-reports accidentally uploaded by users and showing the user's name and address and other personal data. The corresponding photographs/scans will be destroyed immediately after inspection.

#### c) When using our questionnaire

In addition to the provision of the SCHUFA self-report, there is also an option to voluntarily complete an online questionnaire made available on our website. This requires the following information:
* postcode
* year of birth
* gender
* marital status
* nationality
* questions relating to employment
* questions relating to the financial situation

The data will be processed for journalistic-scientific research purposes. The data gathered from the questionnaires, such as e.g. socio-demographic data, will be linked to the data from SCHUFA self-reports and used for analysing how SCHUFA operates.
Data processing is performed in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of voluntarily given consent.
The data obtained from the questionnaires will be uploaded to the Digital Ocean server through an encrypted connection and stored there after obtaining your prior consent. The data collected by us as part of the survey will be stored at AlgorithmWatch gGmbH, at the Open Knowledge Foundation and the editorial offices for an indefinite period for research purposes and for journalistic analyses and linked to other data obtained from the questionnaire for further analyses.

#### d) When using our contact form

Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at the email address made available on our website (info@openschufa.de). This requires that you provide your name, a valid email address and a phone number so that we know who the query is from and can answer and contact you. You can voluntarily provide additional information.
Data processing for the purpose of establishing contact with us is performed for our further journalistic analysis of the data and reporting in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of voluntarily given consent.
The personal data collected by us for the use of the contact function will be automatically erased after your query has been dealt with.

### 3. Disclosure of data

The data obtained from the SCHUFA reports and the questionnaire replies will be transmitted in encrypted form to the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) and the editorial offices of Spiegel Online and Bayerischer Rundfunk Data.
Transmission takes place in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of voluntarily given consent and for the purpose of enabling the recipients to carry out their own journalistic and scientific analysis and reporting. Under no circumstances will the collected data be sold or - except in cases where you have given us your explicit consent - disclosed to third parties for any other reasons.

You can exercise your right of objection by simply sending an email to info@algorithmwatch.de

### 6. Data security

We use the widely used SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology during a visit to our website in combination with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser. Generally, this would be 256-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we employ 128-bit v3 technology instead. Encrypted transmission of a page of our web presence can be recognized from the closed key or padlock icon in the lower status bar at the bottom of your web browser.

Apart from this, we employ appropriate technical and organisational security measures in order to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorised access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved to keep pace with technological development.

Further developments of our website and the offerings on it or in response to statutory and regulatory requirements might make it necessary to amend this Data Privacy Statement.
